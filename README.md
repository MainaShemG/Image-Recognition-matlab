Fruit Classification Project
This repository contains the code and resources for a fruit classification project implemented using MATLAB. The project aims to classify different types of fruits based on their visual features.
Project Overview
The fruit classification project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify fruits into different categories.
I used the pretrained ResNet-50 model for this project.
The data set used is from kaggle . https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sshikamaru/fruit-recognition
